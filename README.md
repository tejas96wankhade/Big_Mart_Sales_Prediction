# BigMart Sales Prediction

A comprehensive machine learning pipeline for predicting item outlet sales using progressive model complexity and advanced feature engineering.

## 🎯 Project Overview

This project implements a complete ML pipeline for the BigMart Sales Prediction problem, featuring:

- **Progressive Model Complexity**: From linear regression to advanced ensemble methods
- **Comprehensive EDA**: Detailed exploratory data analysis and visualization
- **Advanced Feature Engineering**: Domain-specific feature creation and selection
- **Hyperparameter Optimization**: Using Optuna for efficient parameter tuning
- **Robust Evaluation**: Cross-validation and multiple metrics
- **Production Ready**: Modular code structure with testing framework

## 📂 Data

The dataset required for training and testing is already included in this repository under the `Data/raw/` directory:

- `train.csv`
- `test.csv`
- `sample_submission.csv`

This means you can run the notebooks and scripts directly without needing to download additional data.

⚠️ **Note:** If the dataset is updated or replaced, please ensure the files are placed in the same directory structure.
